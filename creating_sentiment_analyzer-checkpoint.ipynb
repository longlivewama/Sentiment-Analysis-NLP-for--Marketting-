This refers to the PS3 version.\\n\\nI've played a lot of shooter and survival games, but Dead Space adds some great twists that make it fresh and exciting.\\n\\nFirst, fighting tactics.  As others have said, you don't go for the usual head or torso shots, you go for the limbs.  This is great fun.\\n\\nSecond, the graphics.  Absolutely gorgeous and faultlessly detailed.  No render errors, no load snags, no frame rate problems.  None.  And no constant reuse of pipes, walls, etc. except where it's appropriate for them to look the same as another spot.\\n\\nThird, environment and sound.  You're kept on your toes by the creepy atmosphere and the sound is fantastic.  Distant clangs, soft nearby noises and other sounds constantly keep you wondering if there's a baddie behind the next corner.\\n\\nFourth, realism.  There are many zero G areas where you have to leap from surface to surface (your boots are magnetic).  These are challenging but not annoying and add a nice twist.  There are also areas where there is no atmosphere and you have to watch your air supply closely.\\n\\nFifth, perspective.  For the first time, your health and your suit's special power meters are on the back of your suit itself, not in a corner of the screen.  The over-the-shoulder perspective is nicely judged - you're not so close to yourself that you can't around, but far enough back to get a good, wide view.  Your body does block a part of the left half of the screen, but I've never found this a problem.\\n\\nThe not so good?  Mainly two things that are far from a killjoy but could have been better.\\n\\nOne, the on-screen displays when you view your \"rig\" inventory, the map, and text logs you collect have absolutely puny text.  They're almost impossible to read on a 34-inch conventional TV using the 3-prong high-quality video (not hi-def).\\n\\nTwo, you upgrade your weapons and suit powers at \"benches\" using \"nodes\" you collect along the way.  Both the nodes and benches are few and far between, so you don't get to upgrade as much as you'd like.\\n\\nThat's it.  Dead Space is simply the best game I've played on the PS3, and possibly the best ever.  It's richly detailed in every possible respect, brings fresh ideas to the 3rd-person shooter experience, and has no functional flaws and no real controller-throwing frustrations.\\n\\nAbsolutely highly recommended!</td>\n",

       "3310  There are a lot of reviews here, so I'll just hit a few highs, plus a low or two.  This refers to the PS3 version.\\n\\nI've played a lot of shooter and survival games, but Dead Space adds some great twists that make it fresh and exciting.\\n\\nFirst, fighting tactics.  As others have said, you don't go for the usual head or torso shots, you go for the limbs.  This is great fun.\\n\\nSecond, the graphics.  Absolutely gorgeous and faultlessly detailed.  No render errors, no load snags, no frame rate problems.  None.  And no constant reuse of pipes, walls, etc. except where it's appropriate for them to look the same as another spot.\\n\\nThird, environment and sound.  You're kept on your toes by the creepy atmosphere and the sound is fantastic.  Distant clangs, soft nearby noises and other sounds constantly keep you wondering if there's a baddie behind the next corner.\\n\\nFourth, realism.  There are many zero G areas where you have to leap from surface to surface (your boots are magnetic).  These are challenging but not annoying and add a nice twist.  There are also areas where there is no atmosphere and you have to watch your air supply closely.\\n\\nFifth, perspective.  For the first time, your health and your suit's special power meters are on the back of your suit itself, not in a corner of the screen.  The over-the-shoulder perspective is nicely judged - you're not so close to yourself that you can't around, but far enough back to get a good, wide view.  Your body does block a part of the left half of the screen, but I've never found this a problem.\\n\\nThe not so good?  Mainly two things that are far from a killjoy but could have been better.\\n\\nOne, the on-screen displays when you view your \"rig\" inventory, the map, and text logs you collect have absolutely puny text.  They're almost impossible to read on a 34-inch conventional TV using the 3-prong high-quality video (not hi-def).\\n\\nTwo, you upgrade your weapons and suit powers at \"benches\" using \"nodes\" you collect along the way.  Both the nodes and benches are few and far between, so you don't get to upgrade as much as you'd like.\\n\\nThat's it.  Dead Space is simply the best game I've played on the PS3, and possibly the best ever.  It's richly detailed in every possible respect, brings fresh ideas to the 3rd-person shooter experience, and has no functional flaws and no real controller-throwing frustrations.\\n\\nAbsolutely highly recommended!   \n",

Cant get it to run. Error 12. Did as the website said, NO JOY. Submitted a ticket, 1 to 2 days response time. Forget it. Sending it back. Dont waste your time\\nAmazon gave a full refund they are the best:-)   \n",

The feel of the keys took a bit of getting used to at first but I really like it now. The software to control colors, macros, etc is very nice and easy to use.\\n\\nI have played around a bit with the ARX app on my phone. I really like it and hope to see more support for it in the future. Leveraging your phone and touchscreen for the secondary display is a great idea!\\n\\n6mo  update: disappointed at how many keys have lost LEDs.  I'd say roughly 1/3 of the key caps have lost at least 1 of the color so you can't get them to match the others. It started happening after a few months and more and more of them continue to fail over time. Not going to replace them 1:1. Sad for such a high end keyboard.   \n",

I found the time between exercises painfully slow... and when you exclude all the talking and prep work and A-button mashing, you only get about 10 minutes of work out of a 30 minute \"workout.\"\\n\\nI got the \"My Fitness Coach\" and it's much more intense than the wii fit. The balance board is basically a gimmick.\\n\\nAfter 6 months of light use on the wii fit, I sold mine on ebay for just about what I paid (wasn't in the mood to price gouge). I was disappointed with it and I STILL don't understand all the hype. It's just not that much fun.   \n",

The finishers can really bring out the masochist in you. I'm currently on master ninja having played the 1st 3 difficulties. The enemy AI is really intelligent that they'll adjust to always find the most effective way to take out Ryu, most of the time thats resorting to cheap tactics such as 6 enemies aggressively attacking you up front(2 of them looking for an unblockable throw while the remaining 4 relentlessly executes combos) and the remaining enemies stay in the back throwing shuriken after shuriken that explode. You will constantly be attacked as soon as you walk through a door without even sighting an enemy, constant cheap shots like this along with the camera looking at everything but the action will be more than enough to frustrate the avg. gamer. There is no theater mode/concept art, or anything of that nature upon completing the game. The unlockables include costumes(1 per difficulty) and these are color variants not even new costumes. This game seemed like a rushed product, but even after dying so many times you'll still keep playing because the combat was so well made.</td>\n",

       "2153  Good-Improved graphics/LOTS of weapons/frequent save points/better music/semi-regenerating health bar/gore/finishing techniques\\n\\nBad-bland environments/glitches and bugs/camera seems to \"fight\" you/low replay value/VERY little unlockable content/enemy AI resorts to cheap tactics\\n\\nThis games combat is its saving grace, its addictive, fun, and satisfying with so many ways to off the opposition. The finishers can really bring out the masochist in you. I'm currently on master ninja having played the 1st 3 difficulties. The enemy AI is really intelligent that they'll adjust to always find the most effective way to take out Ryu, most of the time thats resorting to cheap tactics such as 6 enemies aggressively attacking you up front(2 of them looking for an unblockable throw while the remaining 4 relentlessly executes combos) and the remaining enemies stay in the back throwing shuriken after shuriken that explode. You will constantly be attacked as soon as you walk through a door without even sighting an enemy, constant cheap shots like this along with the camera looking at everything but the action will be more than enough to frustrate the avg. gamer. There is no theater mode/concept art, or anything of that nature upon completing the game. The unlockables include costumes(1 per difficulty) and these are color variants not even new costumes. This game seemed like a rushed product, but even after dying so many times you'll still keep playing because the combat was so well made.   \n",
